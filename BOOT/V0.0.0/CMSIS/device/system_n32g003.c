   2. Please make sure that the selected System clock doesn't exceed your
   device's maximum frequency.

   that:
        - For Low, Medium and High density Value line devices an external 8MHz
          crystal is used to drive the System clock.
        - For Low, Medium and High density devices an external 8MHz crystal is
          used to drive the System clock.
        - For Connectivity line devices an external 25MHz crystal is used to
   drive the System clock. If you are using different crystal you have to adapt
   those functions accordingly.
